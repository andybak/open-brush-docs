# Differences between Open Brush and Tilt Brush

## Features Added to Open Brush

This section only lists features added to the main release. There's plenty of other stuff in [experimental and alternate builds](alternate-and-experimental-builds/).

* Fly Tool
* Plane Guide
* Color Jitter
* Oculus MRC fixes
* [LIV Support](https://www.liv.tv/)
* [Icosa uploads](https://beta.icosa.gallery/)
* [LATK export](https://lightningartist.org/)

Bear in mind this gives a misleading impression of the amount of work that has been put in. There's been a ton of effort on things that don't result in user-visible features but will help ease future development. Special props to [@mikeage](https://github.com/mikeage) for the amazing automated build system.
