# Brushes

The main release of Open Brush as a wide selection of brushes. The [main experimental build](../../alternate-and-experimental-builds/main-experimental-build.md) has even more \(but be warned that a few are currently buggy\).

## Creating your own brushes

There are currently three ways to add new brushes. One requires you to learn your way around Unity a little bit: [https://lachlansleight.medium.com/customizing-tilt-brush-6e9a63bd5425](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://lachlansleight.medium.com/customizing-tilt-brush-6e9a63bd5425)

The other involves editing config files: [https://github.com/TimAidley/open-brush/blob/features/simple-brushes/Docs/UserBrushes.md](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://github.com/TimAidley/open-brush/blob/features/simple-brushes/Docs/UserBrushes.md)

The third builds on this but provides an in-app UI. However it's experimental and has had only a very small amount of testing so far: [https://github.com/IxxyXR/open-brush/wiki/Brush-Editing](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://github.com/IxxyXR/open-brush/wiki/Brush-Editing)

You can also modify existing brushes and create your own variants although this is currently a bit fiddly.
