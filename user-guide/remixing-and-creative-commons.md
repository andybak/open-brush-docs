# Remixing and Creative Commons



Remixing allows others to download, edit, and republish your sketch. If you allow remixing, your content will be published under a CC-BY license. We’ll automatically show attribution on any remixed content we publish.

### **Creative Commons**

[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licenses provide a standard way for content creators to grant someone else permission to use their work. If you allow remixing, your content will be published under a [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode) license. These sketches are then accessible to other Open Brush Sketches users for use, even commercially, in their own sketches.

### **Turning off remixing for your content**

You can choose whether your content can be remixed by selecting from the "Allow remixes" or "Don't allow remixes" options under "Remixes" each time you publish. By default this option is set to "Allow remixes". You can change this setting at any time.

If you don't allow remixing, your content will be published under the standard Google [Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/policies/terms/).

### **Attribution**

Attribution is required under the CC BY license. Any remix we publish will automatically show the source sketch’s title and author underneath the 3D viewer. You retain your copyright and other users get to reuse your work subject to the terms of the license.

### **Deleting remixable content or changing remix settings**

If you delete content that was once remixable, or change the settings to remove remix rights, existing copies of your content used for remixes won’t be deleted.

### **What's eligible for remixing**

Please understand that you may only mark your published sketches as remixable if it consists entirely of content licensable by you under the CC BY license. Some examples of such licensable content are:

* Your originally created content
* Other sketches marked with a CC BY license
