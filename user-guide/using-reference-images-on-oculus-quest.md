To add more images to the Reference Images Panel, you need to connect your Oculus Quest to a PC. Use [these steps](https://support.oculus.com/855551644803876/#faq\_2255729571307786) to learn how to do that.

2. Navigate to '..Quest\Internal shared storage\Open Brush\Media Library\Images\\'
3. Copy image files (.jpg or .png) into this folder.

Images take up video memory inside Open Brush and including too many will cause Open Brush to crash. There are some restrictions on image files.

1. Only .jpg and .png file types.
2. Max image file size is 10Mb.
3. Max image dimension (height and width) is 1024.
