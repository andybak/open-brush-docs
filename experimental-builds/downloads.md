# Downloads

Scroll down for download links...

But read on to help understand which one to pick.

### NOTE! You need to login to Github for the download links to work

Sorry about this. It's more work for me to download and reupload them somewhere else every time I do a build - which is sometimes several times a day.

## How do I download a build?

1. Pick which feature you want. \(Or pick the "integration" version that has all the features\)
2. Pick the correct download for your device

If you just want to play with new features generally click on the download link underneath "Integration Build" below. If you want to test out a specific feature then grab the build for that feature lower down.

### I've chosen a feature. Which file do I download?

When you've decided on a feature and clicked on the download link you'll come to a download page similar to this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/downloads%20%281%29.png)

Each line of text is a link to a particular build.

You most probably want to pick a build that is "experimental" but not "monoscopic".

* For PC you want either "Windows Rift Experimental" or "Windows SteamVR Experimental". The former might be slightly better for Rift and Quest users \(via Oculus Link\). The latter will work for everyone.
* For Quest standalone pick "Oculus Quest Experimental"

The only exception is if you're interested in using the API without being in VR. In that case pick a monoscopic build. You can even run Open Brush on MacOS and use it via API scripts!

## How do I install it?

* PC - just unzip and run the exe that's called "OpenBrush-\(something\)". The something will depend on which build you downloaded.
* Quest - Unzip and install the apk file using [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto)
