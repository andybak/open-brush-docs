## **Painting with Tilt Brush**

### **Paint with Tilt Brush**

1. On your painting controller, use your index finger to pull the trigger.
2. Hold the trigger down and move the controller to paint.

Note: You can switch which hand is your painting controller and which is your palette controller by tapping the bottoms of the two controllers together. This is great to use if a right and left handed person are sharing controllers.

### **Using your palette**

1. On your palette controller, use your thumb to swipe left or right across the thumbpad \(HTC Vive\) or thumbstick \(Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed Reality\).
2. This will allow you to rotate between the three faces of the palette.
3. Using your painting controller, angle your controller towards the palette in order to select items on the palette.
4. Focus the pointer and press trigger to make selections.
5. You can also use the grips on your painting controller to grab panels spawned into the world, and place them onto your palette.

### **Change the width of your brush strokes**

To change the width of your brush strokes:

1. On your painting controller, slide your thumb left or right along the thumbpad \(HTC Vive\) or toggle the thumbstick left or right \(Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed Reality\).
2. Sliding or toggling left will make the brush stroke finer. Sliding or toggling right will make the brush stroke larger.

### **Undo & Redo shortcuts**

If you would like to undo or redo brush strokes you have just made, you can use Undo and Redo in the Tools Panel \(in Beginner Mode\) or these shortcuts \(in Beginner or Advanced Mode\):

* To undo an action:
  * HTC Vive: On the palette controller, click the left side of the thumbpad.
  * Oculus Rift: On the palette controller, click the X button \(right handed\) or A button \(left handed\).
  * Windows Mixed Reality: On the palette controller, click the left side of the thumbpad.

#### **Lost artwork**

Tilt Brush makes saves of your work in Documents\Tilt Brush\Sketches\Autosave. Each new sketch you create will have a separate autosave file, and Tilt Brush will store autosaves from your last five sketches. If you need to access an autosave, just drag it into the Sketches folder using Windows Explorer - it will have a Tilt Brush logo as its thumbnail in the Sketchbook.

#### **After I launch Tilt Brush, a sad Tiltasaurus appears**

This means your Head Mounted Display is not detected, and you'll need troubleshoot your HMD. [Learn to troubleshoot your HTC Vive](http://www.htc.com/managed-assets/shared/desktop/vive/Vive_PRE_User_Guide.pdf) or your [Oculus Rift.](https://product-guides.oculus.com/en-us/documentation/rift/latest/concepts/rgsg-3-ts-setup-troubleshooting/)

#### **Pink screen when starting Tilt Brush**

This is commonly an issue with using an out-of-date version of DirectX. Make sure you're on the latest version of DirectX, and that you're running Tilt Brush on a PC that matches the minimum specs of the VR device you're using.

#### **Tilt Brush crashing or freezing**

Antivirus software can sometimes interfere with Tilt Brush. Try disabling any AV or Firewall software you're running, and try starting Tilt Brush again.

If you downloaded Tilt Brush through Steam, try refreshing the cache by choosing to "Verify Integrity of Game Files..." for Tilt Brush through the Properties window.
