# New Monoscopic Mode

User @rapka on Github (@collige on the Discord) is working on a new, revamped version of the existing [Monoscopic Mode](../developer-notes/github-wiki/monoscopicmode.md) - the mode that allows you to use Open Brush without VR using keyboard and mouse. It's still not quite ready but it's more intuitive than the existing monoscopic mode and uses the WASD keyboard controls familiar to anyone who is used to standard PC game controls.
