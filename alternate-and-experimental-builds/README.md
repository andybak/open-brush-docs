# Alternate and Experimental Builds

## Main Experimental Build

Whilst Open Brush was still Tilt Brush, the original team had a bunch of features and brushes they felt weren't quite ready to be released in the official app. As soon as Tilt Brush was made open source, everyone immediately leapt on these features with great excitement.

## Andybak's Experimental Builds

From procedural geometry to a scripting API as well as more prosaic features such as grid snapping and improvements to model import. Some are fully functioning and some are just a proof of concept that needs more work. One highlight is an extension of work begun by CaptainXap - one of the original Tilt Brush team - to add the ability for users to create their own brush variants without ever leaving VR.

## Moat's Experimental Build

Moatdd appeared like a whirlwind in early 2021 and quickly released feature after feature with great speed. They are a diverse and fascinating set of enhancements and well worth checking out.

## XR Framework Experimental Build

The original VR framework in Unity is deprecated and all new apps are built using the Unity XR Plugin framework. We intend to switch to this going forward and we need to to support newer Oculus features and other headsets such as the Vive Focus.

## Multibrush

Sadly no longer being developed \(as far as we can tell\) and not open source - this is the same as the [Main Experimental Build](main-experimental-build.md) but with two cool extra features:

1. Post-processing effects that change the appearance of your entire scene. 2. Multiuser support: multiple people can paint at the same time and use voice chat in realtime.

\(Note we want to support multiuser in the official Open Brush release in a way that fits well with our open source approuch. Get in touch if you'd like to help in anyway\)
