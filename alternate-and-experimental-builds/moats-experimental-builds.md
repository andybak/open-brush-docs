# Moat's Experimental Builds

## View Axis Unlocking

This feature makes it possible to freely re-orient your workspace to match the sweep of your arm.

You can toggle it by pressing the button marked with a padlock while squeezing both controller grips.

## Lazy Input

VR controllers can sometimes be a little too accurate and responsive, making it difficult to create smooth curves at low movement speeds. The Lazy Input feature will exchange responsiveness for control by applying real-time input averaging.

Toggle it by HOLDING your off-hand trigger and TAPPING the button marked with the rabbit/turtle.

## Wand Stroke Guide

This is a 3D-version of bimanual tape drawing sometimes used in automotive drafting.

Holding the off-hand trigger down will constrain the brush to move in a straight line towards the off-hand controller.

You can curve the line by using your off-hand controller to control the stroke's direction while using your main-hand controller to move the cursor closer to the off-hand controller and control the stroke's orientation.

## Wand Guide Revolver

The Revolver adds a lathe function to the Wand Stroke Guide.

Activate the Revolver by tapping the button marked with a bulls-eye icon while the Wand Stroke Guide is active.

The radius of the revolving arc constraint is dependent on the distance between the main hand controller and the Wand Stroke Guide Axis. You can tap the bulls-eye button to adjust the radius.

The revolver can also be made to automatically sweep around the axis by using the joystick.

## Toplogy Orb and Grid Snap

The Topology Orb will display an illuminated adaptive grid over any brushstroke within its confines \(as long as the brushstroke's shader contributes to the depth buffer\). In particular, it's useful for working with hull brushes.

Toggle the Orb by first bringing your off-hand controller up in front of your right eye, depress the trigger, and then drag your controller over your left eye.

While the Orb is visible, you can apply a grid snap to your brush strokes by HOLDING the Rabbit/Turtle button. Release the button at any time to release the grid snap.
