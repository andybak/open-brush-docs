### 1. Choose a feature build

Links are at the bottom of this page. Either click "**download**" next to the feature you want to try out - or just pick the "All in one" version at the top that contains all the features. Be warned though that sometimes features conflict. If you have problems then try a specific feature build instead

### 2. Choose the correct file for your headset

The download link will take you to a page with multiple versions of that build. You most probably want to pick a build that is "experimental" but not "monoscopic". So:

* For PC you want either "Windows Rift Experimental" or "Windows SteamVR Experimental". The former might be slightly better for Rift and Quest users \(via Oculus Link\). The latter will work for everyone.
* For Quest standalone pick "Oculus Quest Experimental"

The only exception is if you're interested in using the API without being in VR. In that case pick a monoscopic build. You can even run Open Brush on **MacOS** and use it via API scripts!

### How do I install it?

* PC - just unzip and run the exe that's called "OpenBrush-\(something\)". The something will depend on which build you downloaded.
* Quest - Unzip and install the apk file using [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto)
