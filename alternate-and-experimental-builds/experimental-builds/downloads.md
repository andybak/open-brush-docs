**1. Choose the feature build you want to try**\
Links are at the bottom of this page. "All Features in One" or an individual version.

**2. Choose the correct download for your headset**\
The download link will take you to a page with multiple versions of that build. You probably want a build that is "experimental" but not "monoscopic". **PC:** either "Windows Rift Experimental" or "Windows SteamVR Experimental". (The former might be slightly better for Rift and Quest users (via Oculus Link). The latter will work for everyone). **Quest: **Pick "Oculus Quest Experimental".

The only exception is if you're interested in using Open Brush without VR. In that case pick a monoscopic build. You can even run Open Brush on **MacOS **and use it via API scripts!

**3. Install**

* **PC:** just unzip and run the exe that's called "OpenBrush-(something)". The something will depend on which build you downloaded.
* **Quest:** Unzip and install the apk file using [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto). Once installed the app will appear under "Unknown Sources" in your list of apps. (If you've got other versions of Open Brush installed they will be unaffected but sometimes a sketch that uses a new feature such as new brushes won't load properly in a version that doesn't have that feature)

## List of Builds

### All in One

This version has all the features included. It also contains [Moat's features](../moats-experimental-builds.md). Be warned though that sometimes features conflict and this might be less stable. If you have problems then try a specific feature build instead.  [Downloads](https://nightly.link/IxxyXR/open-brush/workflows/build/integration)
