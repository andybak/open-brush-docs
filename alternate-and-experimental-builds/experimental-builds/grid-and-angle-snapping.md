### What does it do?

1. It expands snapping so that it works when you grab and duplicate groups of brush strokes.
2. A wider range of snap angles are supported \(currently multiples of 15 degrees up to 90 degrees\)
3. Grid snapping for position is supported \(currently buggy\)

### What's it good for?

Building regular structures up by making multiple copies of brush strokes

### How do I install it?

Download a build for your headset from the link above and unzip it. You can run the Windows exe directly. To install the Quest apk use SideQuest: [https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/](https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/)

### How do I use it?

Click the new button on the Labs panel to open the new Snap Settings panel

### Known Issues

1. Angle snapping can feel a bit fiddly especially at larger angles. Adding a "shadow" unsnapped copy of the selected strokes would help make it more intuitive
2. The position snapping grid needs some kind of preview visualisation.
3. Position snapping is weird and jittery especially if you scale the canvas away from "human" scale. I think I need to compensate for the offset between the controller and the grab point of the selection but I couldn't get it to work correctly. It works slightly better if you use angle snap as well as position snapping.
4. There's no control over the snap point. Stuff you draw snap to a point different to where you originally drew them relative to the grid. 

## How do I get help
