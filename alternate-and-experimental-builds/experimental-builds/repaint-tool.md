# Repaint Tool

### Status

Fairly solid. A bit more finessing on the user interface and interactions is needed. Resize is a bit quirky sometimes but I need more feedback and testing to nail that.

[Downloads](downloads.md#repaint-tool)

### What does it do?

It improves on the existing Recolor tool. It combines the existing experimental "Rebrush" tool and adds "Resize" to allow you to change the stroke size of existing strokes.

In addition it also ties in with the recently added "Color Jitter" feature which itself has been improved. You can now recolor and resize existing strokes and at the same time add random variation ("jitter") to them.

### What's it good for?

Changing existing strokes - color, size and brush.

### How do I install it?

Download a build for your headset from the link above and unzip it. You can run the Windows exe directly. To install the Quest apk use SideQuest: [https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/](https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/)

### How do I use it?

The Recolor button on the Tools Panel has been replaced with "Repaint". When you select it, a side panel appears with 4 toggle buttons: Recolor, Resize, Rebrush and Jitter. 

Any combination of these 4 options can be selected at any time. If you choose "jitter" then set your chosen amount of jitter using the button with the dice icon at the bottom of the Color Picker Panel

### Known Issues

1. Resize is slightly unpredictable. I need to spend a bit more time figuring out why.
2. You have to keep switching back to the Repaint tool whenever you choose a new brush. Rebrush didn't work this way but if we copy how rebrush worked then it would make it harder to change brush size for the "Resize" feature.

## How do I get help

Come over to the [Open Brush Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fS69VdFXpk) and chat to me ( @andybak#5425 ). I'm on UK time (currently UTC+1) but I check in fairly regularly.

### Can I see it in action?
