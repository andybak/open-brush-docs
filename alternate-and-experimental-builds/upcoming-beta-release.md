# Upcoming Beta release

This is a placeholder until we work up some proper documentation:

## New Features

1. Jitter (randomize color, size, position both while painting and applied to existing strokes)
2. repaint (modifying existing stroke size, color, brush)
3. stencil settings (control the appearance of the current 3d guides)
4. hide brushes via config setting (useful for creating a subset of brushes for specific purposes)
5. Moat's stuff (hard to explain! See: https://docs.openbrush.app/alternate-and-experimental-builds/moats-experimental-builds )
6. Snapping (grid snapping for new brush strokes and when cloning/moving selections. Angle snapping when cloning/moving selections)
7. Merging brush strokes (import strokes from saved sketches into the current sketch)
